# magisk-module-repo-json
the magisk module repo doesn't have a json file, at least I couldn't find it, so I forked their gen from the alt repo and made the json file myself

fox magisk module manager hasn't a simple quick explaination on how to add a repo, even tho it's like 2 steps, they tell you to refer to the docs, anyways, just go to "manage repos" in the settings, scroll all the way down and press on "add repo", it'll ask for a URL, copy the url of the raw json file, here it is incase you don't know how to find that URL
